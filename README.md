Designed to be bound to another service using systemd.

### ROADMAP

* [X] Enable node on load balancer
* [X] Drain node off load balancer conditionally
* [ ] Get IP Address from an interface
* [ ] Create basic fleet service file example
* [ ] Set up Docker build that packages *just* the binary build
